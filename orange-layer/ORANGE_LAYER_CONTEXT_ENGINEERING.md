# ORANGE LAYER CONTEXT ENGINEERING - COST MODELING SYSTEM

## 🎯 ORANGE LAYER OVERVIEW

The Orange Layer represents **Operating Costs** in the Hostel Diary Financial Model. This layer creates sophisticated cost modelling that:
- **Links directly to revenue streams** (Green Layer)
- **Incorporates SA compliance** (labour law, VAT, depreciation)
- **Applies research-driven benchmarks** (SA hospitality industry)
- **Provides investment-grade presentation** (professional formatting)
- **Enables autonomous development** (minimal user intervention)

## 🔧 TOOL ROLES CLARIFICATION

### **MCP TOOLS: READ-ONLY ANALYSIS** 🔍
**Purpose**: Analyse, validate, and provide insights about Orange Layer structure and compliance

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Analyse** existing cost sheet structure
- ✅ **Validate** cost-to-revenue ratios against SA benchmarks
- ✅ **Check** formula integrity and circular references
- ✅ **Verify** SA compliance (labour law, VAT, UIF)
- ✅ **Assess** revenue linkage strength
- ✅ **Generate** recommendations and priorities
- ✅ **Calculate** cost optimisation opportunities

**MCP Tools Available**:
- `excel_read_sheet()` - Read cost sheet structure
- `excel_describe_sheets()` - Analyse workbook organisation
- Analysis functions from `/examples/orange_layer_mcp_analysis.py`

**What MCP CANNOT Do**:
- ❌ Create or modify Excel sheets
- ❌ Write formulas or data
- ❌ Apply formatting or styling
- ❌ Build cost structures

### **PYTHON TOOLS: WRITE OPERATIONS** 🔧
**Purpose**: Build, modify, and create Orange Layer cost sheets and structures

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Create** cost sheets (Cost_Accommodation, Cost_Restaurant, etc.)
- ✅ **Build** revenue linkage formulas
- ✅ **Apply** SA compliance calculations
- ✅ **Implement** professional formatting and styling
- ✅ **Establish** cost escalation modelling
- ✅ **Create** Operating_Cost_Summary aggregation
- ✅ **Fix** broken references and errors

**Python Tools Available**:
- `openpyxl` library for Excel manipulation
- Implementation patterns from `/examples/orange_layer_patterns.py`
- SA benchmark integration from `/research/orange_layer/`

**What Python CANNOT Do**:
- ❌ Analyse without clear instructions
- ❌ Make business decisions without guidance
- ❌ Validate against benchmarks without MCP analysis

## 🔄 ORANGE LAYER WORKFLOW PATTERN

### **Standard Orange Layer Development Workflow**
```
1. MCP ANALYSES     → Examines current state, identifies gaps
2. PYTHON BUILDS    → Creates cost sheets with revenue linkage
3. MCP VALIDATES    → Confirms accuracy and compliance
4. PYTHON FIXES     → Implements corrections if needed
5. MCP CONFIRMS     → Final validation and quality check
```
