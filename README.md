## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated financial modelling system specifically designed for hostel operations in South Africa. The system combines AI-assisted development with robust technical validation to create investment-grade financial models.

### Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Assisted Development**: Advanced prompt engineering framework for consistent model generation
- **🇿🇦 SA Compliance**: Built-in South African labour law, tax, and regulatory compliance
- **🛡️ Technical Validation**: Three-layer validation architecture with automatic error recovery
- **📊 Progressive Architecture**: Revenue → Cost → Cash Flow → Valuation layers
- **🎨 Design Standards**: Enforced Century Gothic font and professional colour schemes
- **📈 Git-Integrated Workflow**: Complete audit trail for financial model evolution

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Model Layers
```
📈 Revenue Layer (Blue)     → Accommodation, F&B, Ancillary income
🟠 Cost Layer (Orange)      → Labour, utilities, supplies, compliance  
💰 Cash Flow Layer (Green)  → Operating, investing, financing flows
💎 Valuation Layer (Navy)   → DCF, multiples, sensitivity analysis
```

### Technical Framework
```
Layer 1: Python Creates    → Safe patterns with error handling
Layer 2: MCP Validates     → Comprehensive checking
Layer 3: Python Fixes      → Automatic recovery
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Excel/LibreOffice Calc
- Git for version control

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bakiel/hostel-diary-financial-model.git
cd hostel-diary-financial-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Your First Model
```bash
# Use the comprehensive prompt for AI-assisted development
python scripts/generate_model.py --location="Cape Town" --rooms=20 --target-roi=15
```

## 🟠 Cost Layer Development

### Git Workflow for Cost Components
```bash
# Create cost layer branch
git checkout -b feature/cost-layer-foundation

# Commit cost categories progressively
git commit -m "cost(labour): add SA minimum wage compliance"
git commit -m "cost(utilities): implement Eskom tariff structure"
git commit -m "cost(compliance): add SARS tax calculations"
```

### Cost Categories
- **Labour**: Staff costs with SA compliance (UIF, SDL, PAYE)
- **Utilities**: Electricity, water, gas with municipal tariffs
- **Supplies**: Consumables, inventory, replacement schedules
- **Maintenance**: Repairs, services, contracts
- **Marketing**: Digital, print, events
- **Compliance**: Permits, licences, insurance
- **Overhead**: Rent, admin, professional services

## 🇿🇦 South African Compliance

### Built-in Regulatory Features
- **Labour Relations Act**: Minimum wage, overtime, leave provisions
- **UIF Contributions**: 2% (1% employer + 1% employee)
- **Skills Development Levy**: 1% of gross wages
- **PAYE**: Progressive tax brackets
- **VAT**: 15% standard rate with exemptions
- **Municipal Rates**: Property taxes and service charges

## 🎨 Design Standards

### Non-Negotiable Requirements
- **Font**: Century Gothic ONLY (Zero tolerance policy)
- **Colours**: Exact RGB values for consistency
- **Layout**: Professional business model standards
- **Validation**: Automated checking for compliance

## 📈 Development Workflow

### Phase-Based Development
1. **Context Loading**: Business requirements and constraints
2. **Design Foundation**: Technical architecture and standards
3. **Progressive Building**: Layer-by-layer construction
4. **Integration**: Cross-layer validation and linking
5. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and compliance

### Git Commit Standards
```bash
# Feature commits
feat(revenue): add seasonal occupancy multipliers
feat(cost): implement labour cost calculator

# Bug fixes
fix(calculations): resolve UIF ceiling calculation
fix(design): correct Century Gothic font application

# Documentation
docs(compliance): update SARS tax tables
docs(readme): add cost layer development guide
```

## 🔍 Validation Framework

### Automated Checks
- **Technical**: Formula integrity, reference validation
- **Design**: Font compliance, colour standards
- **Compliance**: SA regulatory requirements
- **Performance**: Calculation efficiency, file size

### Quality Gates
Every model must pass all validation gates before deployment:
- ✅ Design consistency (Century Gothic, colours)
- ✅ Technical robustness (formulas, references)
- ✅ SA compliance (labour, tax, regulatory)
- ✅ Business logic validation (ratios, benchmarks)
